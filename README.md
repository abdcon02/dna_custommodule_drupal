# DNA Module
### Created by Connor Abdelnoor
#### For an Assessment at Epicodus on: </br> June 5 2015

###Purpose
DNA is composed of a double helix. This means that there are two sequences of nucleotides that run side by side. If the current index of one side has an "A" value, the other side has a "T" value. If the current index of one side has a "C" value, the other side will have a "G" value. The custom module presents a form where the user can enter in one half of their DNA helix. Then the module generates the other half and print both sides on the browser.
